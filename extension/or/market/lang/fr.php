<p>
<b>Cash cows</b>
<br>
"Cash cows", often referred to as "money-printing machines," are businesses with a substantial market share but relatively low market growth rates. Microsoft\'s Windows and Office, along with Google\'s search business, serve as prime examples of cash cows or money-printing machines.
</p>
<p>
<b>Stars</b>
<br>
"Stars" are promising emerging businesses that capture a significant market share in rapidly growing markets. A prime example is Amazon, which originated as an online bookstore but diversified into the thriving cloud computing industry, establishing itself as a market leader. While these star businesses may not generate immediate profits and often require substantial investment, they represent the future. Once a star business transitions into a cash cow, the company enters the next phase of explosive growth.
</p>
<p>
<b>Question marks</b>
<br>
"Question marks" represent businesses with a modest market share but experiencing rapid market growth. A notable example is Google\'s ventures into artificial intelligence, robotics, and autonomous driving. The term "question marks" is aptly used because their potential to evolve into star businesses or cash cows remains uncertain; they could either thrive or fade away.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dogs</b>
<br>
"Dogs" represent businesses with significantly low market share and limited prospects for growth, evoking a feeling of regret or reluctance in abandoning them, despite their lack of appeal. Notable examples include Microsoft\'s smartphones, Tencent\'s microblogging platform, and Baidu\'s e-commerce endeavors.
